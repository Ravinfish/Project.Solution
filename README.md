# PortlandBridge

### By Ravin Fisher

This is an application that showcases classes, businesses and events targeted for the BIPOC community

## Technologies Used

 - C#
 - MySQL
 - Entity Framework Core

 ## Setup/Installation

 1. To run locally on computer, clone the main branch of this [repository] (https://github.com/Ravinfish/Project.Solution.git).
 2. dotnet run build
 3. dotnet watch run
 4. As the project sits right now, you would also have to download the MySQL database, but I am not currently sharing that, so it would leave you with a base project to add to.

 ## Stretch Goals
 
 - Add user Authentication:
  - Admin role for making edits/deleteing
  - User specific
    - Save/Favorite places/events
    - Set up reminders
    - add to calendar
    - leave comments/reviews
- Build a scraper so that I can pull data from multiple places
- Add an events section
- reformat page so that it has better flow
- Would love for this to be a mobile application

## Known Bugs

Everything functions currently, the flow is not great. I don't want just anyone to be able to edit and delete places currently
